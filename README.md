Virtual EDucation Academy

CyberLab WebCity VEDA Project is in alfa stage.We are trying hard to get it online soon

This project aims to solve some of the crucial problems faced in Online Education which stands to be the only solution in this time of COVID-19. Some of the problems faced generally are:

Different class links for different classes and that too has to be searched from various sources like Mail, Whatsapp etc Study Material of all courses scattered everywhere ( Some may be in Google Drive or some may be in MyCloud or some may be in Mails ) Professors unable to take legit attendance Being at home, it becomes difficult to keep everything in mind about classes (like Time-Table) In total, this project tries to solve some of the problems of this kind to much extent by showing every information at a single place. Moreover, a user sees the information relevant only to him/her.

No need to find study materials of a particular course in a long list of mails. No need to mess up with a large time table having all courses for students from all programs and years because this will be done by this project No need to find the class links in a long list of mails (especially when you are getting late for class) No more proxies or fake names in the class; Only one attendance per student in a class and professor can even see the details of attendance of students This project can be used by Admin or Student or Professor. A student can

see all his/her details see all the courses in which he/she is enrolled mark attendance for an ongoing class access the link of ongoing class see the Time-Table only for the courses he/she is enrolled in access all the study materials of all the courses in which he/she is enrolled in a systematic manner A professor can
